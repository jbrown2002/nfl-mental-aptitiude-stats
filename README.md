# NFL Mental Aptitude Testing

In this research, the Wonderlic Test has been applied to the success metrics of passer rating, rushing yards per game, and receiving yards per game. Furthermore, the combine metrics of vertical jump and fory yard dash were included as alternative explanations for the on the field performance metrics of career passing yard, career rushing yards, and career receiving yards.
